# DECISIONS

Standing design and workflow rulings. Once something is here, treat it as settled, do not relitigate it.
Add a dated entry whenever a durable decision is made.

## 2026-10-17, Local-first scope
Build and perfect the LOCAL single-player game before any cloud/online work. Deferred until Jess
explicitly switches phase: Firebase (auth, Firestore, RTDB, cloud saves), Cloudflare TURN worker,
and the entire multiplayer/co-op/networking stack (js/net/: social, net, coop, ranking, signups),
plus friends, rooms, online leaderboards. Multiplayer is tied to the cloud work and deferred with it.

## 2026-10-17, English-native development
Jess develops in English, not Spanish. Author all new user-facing strings directly in English.
Inherited Spanish string literals stay as-is (they are the runtime i18n keys via lang-en.js). Do
NOT add lang-en.js entries or Spanish translations for our own new strings. New features render
English-only, and that is intended. Jess is not maintaining the Spanish side.

## 2026-10-17, Edit boundary (propose-first vs free-edit)
Dividing line: "does this change what the game does when you run it?"
- Yes (game code, js/data/*.js, dev.html, build config, assets): PROPOSE-first, Jess applies by hand.
- No (Markdown project docs: CONTEXT/DEVLOG/DECISIONS/BALANCE/TODO/ISSUES): assistant edits directly.
Note: js/data/*.js looks like docs but IS game data (the game loads it), so it is propose-first.

## 2026-10-17, Git execution
The AI assistant never runs git, ever. It provides commands and strategy only; Jess runs all git himself.

## 2026-10-17, Docs portability
All project docs live in-repo (not in a tool's private memory) so git pull carries them to Claude
Desktop at home. The repo is the single shared source of truth between the two tools.

## 2026-10-17, Remote visibility via local checkout (not a GitHub connector)
There is no GitHub connector available, and GitHub's dynamic pages (commits, branches, issues, PRs)
are JS-rendered and cannot be fetched reliably even though the repo (Jess-Rivera/pokesurvivor_fork)
is public (only the static landing page / README fetches). So the bridge between work and home stays
the LOCAL CHECKOUT: when the agent needs to see remote state, Jess pulls or checks out the branch
locally and the agent reads the working tree and git metadata directly. This does not change the Git
rule (Jess still runs all git himself) or the local-first scope.

## 2026-10-17, Source-only repo: gitignore the build output (Option A)
Decision: do NOT version-control generated build output. Jess runs the game locally via dev.html and
only builds (`node tools/build.js`) when he is ready to publish to a host (chosen later). GitHub Pages
is explicitly NOT used ("i dont want Pages"). So the three generated files are now gitignored:
index.html, js/app.min.js, version.json (tools/cache/ was already ignored). They are regenerated at
publish time, not tracked. To stop tracking the already-committed copies, Jess runs (git is his):
  git rm --cached index.html js/app.min.js version.json
This removes them from tracking but keeps them on disk. Rationale: generated artifacts cause pointless
merge conflicts (minified/obfuscated output cannot be meaningfully merged); keeping source-only is the
cleaner practice and ends that friction. If Jess later hosts somewhere that needs committed build
output (e.g. GitHub Pages serving files directly), revisit, the better path then is a CI build step.

## 2026-10-17, SEO/publishing pipeline is inherited and dormant
tools/export_data.js and tools/make_seo_pages.py are the ORIGINAL owner's SEO/publishing pipeline
(generate text pages from game data so a canvas game is crawlable; hardcoded to pokesurvivor.com and
the original repo JPTER78/pokesurvivor). Jess has never run them and only runs `node tools/build.js`.
They stay dormant and untouched until Jess picks a host and decides on public discoverability, at which
point the hardcoded URLs would need rewriting. Their output (tools/cache/gamedata.json and the es/en
SEO page folders) is not maintained by us.

## 2026-10-17, Performance stance
Vision first, trim fat later. Ignore small per-frame millisecond differences at this stage. BUT a
visible framerate collapse (e.g. 60fps to ~22fps at high enemy density) is a FEEL problem and is
addressed immediately, not deferred.
